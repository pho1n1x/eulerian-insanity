# Problem 2 -- [Even Fibonacci numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

Difficulty rating: **5%**

### Description

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

_1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ..._

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values _do not_ exceed __four million__, find the _sum_ of the _even-valued_ terms.

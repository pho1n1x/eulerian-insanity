# Problem 14 - [Longest Collatz sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)

Difficulty rating: **5%**

### Description

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

> n → n/2 (n is even)

> n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with _13_, we generate the following sequence:

> 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (__Collatz Problem__), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.

Which __starting number__, _under_ one million, produces the _longest_ chain?

__NOTE__: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

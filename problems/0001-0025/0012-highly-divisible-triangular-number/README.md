# Problem 12 - [Highly divisible triangular number](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12)

Difficulty rating: **5%**

### Description

The sequence of __triangle numbers__ is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the _7th_ triangle number would be `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28`. The first ten terms would be:

> 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
__1__: 1
__3__: 1, 3
__6__: 1, 2, 3, 6
__10__: 1, 2, 5, 10
__15__: 1, 3, 5, 15
__21__: 1, 3, 7, 21
__28__: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

We can see that _28_ is the first triangle number to have over _five_ divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have __over__ _five hundred_ divisors?

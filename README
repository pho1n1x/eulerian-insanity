# Introduction
This repository is used to store (and maybe showcase ^^) all of my solved problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

Each problem has its own folder and inside the folder will be a README with the description of the problem and one (or multiple) source file(s) with my solution.

# Motivation
As it is stated on the Project Euler website, I am someone

> whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical

And that is the reason why I started trying to solve the problems presented on Project Euler. My attempts and solution may sometimes (or more like always :D) be amateurish, but that is exactly why I started doing it -- to learn something new and improve my skills. :)
